# An application for restaurant operations - *Feast*

## Description
I want to develop an application for restaurant operations called Feast! 
Feast aims to improve the efficiency of restaurant operations.
For example, Feast can track the status of each table (available or not), 
record the items the customers ordered for each table, 
generate the bill and manage the list of customers waiting for a table.
Managers will use Feast to help operate their restaurants, 
and this application would be applicable to every restaurant after an adaption.
Developing an application for restaurant operations sounds practical. 
I love to apply what I learned in real life. Also, 
I dream of having a restaurant and hope to use my self-developed 
application to help operate my own restaurant.
